This is my first github repository.
I am an international student studying Master of Information Technology in Monash University.
The course I am studying does not require any undergraduate background.
And I have enroled four foundation units in semester 1, which are programing, database, unix and communacation.
It is really excited for me to start a new life in Australia.
I will do my best to learn those theory and technology so that I can have a opportunity to stay at Australia and get a good job.
And, yes. I will try some introductions, I like :play: :meat: , and :sleep:, emmmm :pizza:. Well, some of them are not working.
